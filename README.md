# Hotel Reservation Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python code and data for analyzing hotel reservation data. The code in this repository focuses on data visualization and analysis of various aspects of hotel reservations, including cancellation trends, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and more.


## Code Explanation

In this repository, you'll find Python code that performs the following analyses:

- Cancellation trends for different months.
- Visualization of the top 10 countries with the highest number of canceled reservations.
- ADR trends over time, comparing canceled and not canceled reservations.
- Summary statistics for object-type columns in the dataset.
- Visualization of reservation counts by hotel type and cancellation status.

## Visualization

We have included several visualizations in this repository to help you understand and interpret the data. These visualizations are generated using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. You can find these visualizations in the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts.
